this is a test on the aerver-side with nods.js and mySQL

to start please load this page with the route "/fetch-tweets"- this route will load a JSON objects to a mySql data base.
there are 3 words , for each one an API.
the three tables will load immideatly to the data base.

to continue use the route "/tweet-report" - this route will return the number of words from each table in the data base- to the screen,
